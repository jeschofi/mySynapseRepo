							"Description": "A product is anything that can be offered to a market that might satisfy a want or need by potential customers.    That product is the sum of all physical, psychological, symbolic, and service attributes associated with it.\n\nThere are two basic types of products:\n\n- Tangible (physical)\n- Intangible (non-physical) such as services\n\nA service is a non-material or intangible product - such as professional consultancy, maintenance service, repair service etc.\nEach product has its own benefits, application, brand name, and packaging that gives it its own identity and distinguishing characteristics.\n\nEvery business or organization has business rules that define precisely what a product is.    While we intuitively know what a product is, we must quantify that knowledge and associated business rules with consistent definitions that can be implemented within the organization in strategies and applications.\n\nA product typically goes through five stages of development:\n\n(1) Idea Stage - involving a thorough evaluation of the potential product\n\n(2) Concept Stage - determines customer acceptance by testing and presentation to consumers and distribution channel members.   Specific aspects regarding quality, dependability, reliability, warranty, packaging, service, pricing, terms of sale, sales and distribution channels, advertising and promotions are evaluated.\n\n(3) Product Development Stage - transforms the prototype product into an actual product for mass sale.   This stage requires close interaction between both marketing and manufacturing.\n\n(4) Test Marketing Stage - may or may not be used since it is an expensive and time-consuming process.  Test marketing involves evaluating various product options and alternatives.\n\n(5) Commercialization - It is very expensive to launch a new product so commercialization only applies to those specific products that are actually going to be sold to the market.\n\nProducts tend to be categorized as either:  Industrial goods and consumer goods\n\nIndustrial goods are used to produce other products .\n\nIndustrial goods may be further divided into:\n\n- Raw materials\n- Equipment\n- Pre-built materials \n- Supplies.\n\nConsumer goods are intended for consumption by the general public.\n\nConsumer goods may be further divided into:\n\n- Durable goods\n- Nondurable goods\n- Packaged goods\n\nA product may be a member of a product family or product line.\n\nA product family is a grouping of products or services that are related to each other by common function, functionality, design platform or similar characteristics.\n\nMembers of a product family frequently have many common parts and assemblies.\n\nProduct families are the highest level of grouping for forecasting, capacity planning or related functions.\n\nEx:\nThe Apple Macintosh family of products consists of the product lines:\n- Mac mini\n- MacBook Pro\n- Mac Pro\n\nA product line is a grouping of products that are closely related in usage, functionality or marketing characteristics.\n\nA Product Family typically is created to address one or five functions:\n\n1. To increase profits and not erode the sales of existing products\n\n2. To attract additional Markets or Market Segments\n\n3. To counter competitor's products\n\n4. To fill a gap in an existing Product Family.\n\n5. To promote sales of other products in the family line\n\nLine Depth refers to the number of products in the product line.\n\nLine consistency refers to how closely related the products are that make up the product line.\n\nLine vulnerability refers to the percentage of sales or profits that are derived from only a few products in the product line.\n\nProduct width refers to the number of different product lines sold by a company.\n\nProduct mix refers to the total number of products sold in all product lines.\n\nLine extension refers to the adding of a new product to a line.\n\n\"Trading up or brand leveraging\" refers to adding a product of better quality to a product line than the other products in that line.\n\n\"Trading down\" refers to adding a product of lesser quality to a product line than the other products in that line.\n\nIf a line of products is sold with the same brand name, this is referred to as family branding.\nStrategy and decisions regarding a product line are usually incorporated in a high-level marketing plan addressing product line strategy, sales, channels, distribution channels, pricing and related issues.\nA product-line manager is responsible for a product line and supervises several product managers who are responsible for individual products within the line.\nProduct-line managers typically have the following responsibilities:\n- Expansion and composition of a product line\n- Evaluate the effects of product mixes on the profitability of other items in the line\n- Planning and allocation of resources to individual products in the line\nA product is normally associated with a brand strategy - manufacturer, private or generic.\n\n1. Manufacturer-  or 'national' branding in which the brand is assigned by the manufacturer of the Product.\n\n2. Private - or 'dealer' branding in which the brand is assigned by the retailer or wholesaler of the Product.\n\n3. Generic - in which the Product is not marked with any identification.   Generic brands are a means for manufacturers to increase profits by saving on advertising, packaging or other costs associated with manufacturer or private branding.\n\nA brand is name, term, sign, symbol or design or a combination of these which identify the goods or services and differentiate them from those of competitors'\n\nA Trade mark is a brand or some part of the brand that is given legal protection because it is capable of exclusive appropriation and representation.\n\nManufacturers can use their own brands (known as Manufacturers' brands) or brands of their distributors (Distributors' brands).\n\nManufacturers/ distributors use brand names for a variety of reasons ranging from simple identification purposes to having legal protection for unique features of the products from imitations.\n\nBrands help consumers recognize certain quality parameters. In some cases, brands are just used to endow the product with unique story and character which itself can be a basis for product differentiation.\n\nIndividual brands have their own identity and the corporate or common name is not used to promote its equity.\n\nIndividual branding requires more expensive advertising and brand extensive brand creation investments.  By extension, each new brand does not benefit from the positive perceptions of earlier brands.\n\nBy contrast, family branding has several advantages.\n\nEach new product is quickly associated with the other products and brand in terms of quality and benefits.\n\nReduced or eliminated time for name identification and advertising for name recognition purposes.",

That product is the sum of all physical, psychological, symbolic, and service attributes associated with it.\\n\\nThere are two basic types of products:\\n\\n- Tangible (physical)\\n- Intangible (non-physical) such as services\\n\\nA service is a non-material or intangible product - such as professional consultancy, maintenance service, repair service etc.\\nEach product has its own benefits, application, brand name, and packaging that gives it its own identity and distinguishing characteristics.\\n\\nEvery business or organization has business rules that define precisely what a product is.    While we intuitively know what a product is, we must quantify that knowledge and associated business rules with consistent definitions that can be implemented within the organization in strategies and applications.\\n\\nA product typically goes through five stages of development:\\n\\n(1) Idea Stage - involving a thorough evaluation of the potential product\\n\\n(2) Concept Stage - determines customer acceptance by testing and presentation to consumers and distribution channel members.   Specific aspects regarding quality, dependability, reliability, warranty, packaging, service, pricing, terms of sale, sales and distribution channels, advertising and promotions are evaluated.\\n\\n(3) Product Development Stage - transforms the prototype product into an actual product for mass sale.   This stage requires close interaction between both marketing and manufacturing.\\n\\n(4) Test Marketing Stage - may or may not be used since it is an expensive and time-consuming process.  Test marketing involves evaluating various product options and alternatives.\\n\\n(5) Commercialization - It is very expensive to launch a new product so commercialization only applies to those specific products that are actually going to be sold to the market.\\n\\nProducts tend to be categorized as either:  Industrial goods and consumer goods\\n\\nIndustrial goods are used to produce other products .\\n\\nIndustrial goods may be further divided into:\\n\\n- Raw materials\\n- Equipment\\n- Pre-built materials \\n- Supplies.\\n\\nConsumer goods are intended for consumption by the general public.\\n\\nConsumer goods may be further divided into:\\n\\n- Durable goods\\n- Nondurable goods\\n- Packaged goods\\n\\nA product may be a member of a product family or product line.\\n\\nA product family is a grouping of products or services that are related to each other by common function, functionality, design platform or similar characteristics.\\n\\nMembers of a product family frequently have many common parts and assemblies.\\n\\nProduct families are the highest level of grouping for forecasting, capacity planning or related functions.\\n\\nEx:\\nThe Apple Macintosh family of products consists of the product lines:\\n- Mac mini\\n- MacBook Pro\\n- Mac Pro\\n\\nA product line is a grouping of products that are closely related in usage, functionality or marketing characteristics.\\n\\nA Product Family typically is created to address one or five functions:\\n\\n1. To increase profits and not erode the sales of existing products\\n\\n2. To attract additional Markets or Market Segments\\n\\n3. To counter competitor's products\\n\\n4. To fill a gap in an existing Product Family.\\n\\n5. To promote sales of other products in the family line\\n\\nLine Depth refers to the number of products in the product line.\\n\\nLine consistency refers to how closely related the products are that make up the product line.\\n\\nLine vulnerability refers to the percentage of sales or profits that are derived from only a few products in the product line.\\n\\nProduct width refers to the number of different product lines sold by a company.\\n\\nProduct mix refers to the total number of products sold in all product lines.\\n\\nLine extension refers to the adding of a new product to a line.\\n\\n\\\"Trading up or brand leveraging\\\" refers to adding a product of better quality to a product line than the other products in that line.\\n\\n\\\"Trading down\\\" refers to adding a product of lesser quality to a product line than the other products in that line.\\n\\nIf a line of products is sold with the same brand name, this is referred to as family branding.\\nStrategy and decisions regarding a product line are usually incorporated in a high-level marketing plan addressing product line strategy, sales, channels, distribution channels, pricing and related issues.\\nA product-line manager is responsible for a product line and supervises several product managers who are responsible for individual products within the line.\\nProduct-line managers typically have the following responsibilities:\\n- Expansion and composition of a product line\\n- Evaluate the effects of product mixes on the profitability of other items in the line\\n- Planning and allocation of resources to individual products in the line\\nA product is normally associated with a brand strategy - manufacturer, private or generic.\\n\\n1. Manufacturer-  or 'national' branding in which the brand is assigned by the manufacturer of the Product.\\n\\n2. Private - or 'dealer' branding in which the brand is assigned by the retailer or wholesaler of the Product.\\n\\n3. Generic - in which the Product is not marked with any identification.   Generic brands are a means for manufacturers to increase profits by saving on advertising, packaging or other costs associated with manufacturer or private branding.\\n\\nA brand is name, term, sign, symbol or design or a combination of these which identify the goods or services and differentiate them from those of competitors'\\n\\nA Trade mark is a brand or some part of the brand that is given legal protection because it is capable of exclusive appropriation and representation.\\n\\nManufacturers can use their own brands (known as Manufacturers' brands) or brands of their distributors (Distributors' brands).\\n\\nManufacturers/ distributors use brand names for a variety of reasons ranging from simple identification purposes to having legal protection for unique features of the products from imitations.\\n\\nBrands help consumers recognize certain quality parameters. In some cases, brands are just used to endow the product with unique story and character which itself can be a basis for product differentiation.\\n\\nIndividual brands have their own identity and the corporate or common name is not used to promote its equity.\\n\\nIndividual branding requires more expensive advertising and brand extensive brand creation investments.  By extension, each new brand does not benefit from the positive perceptions of earlier brands.\\n\\nBy contrast, family branding has several advantages.\\n\\nEach new product is quickly associated with the other products and brand in terms of quality and benefits.\\n\\nReduced or eliminated time for name identification and advertising for name recognition

								"Description": "A product is anything that can be offered to a market that might satisfy a want or need by potential customers.    That product is the sum of all physical, psychological, symbolic, and service attributes associated with it.\n\nThere are two basic types of products:\n\n- Tangible (physical)\n- Intangible (non-physical) such as services\n\nA service is a non-material or intangible product - such as professional consultancy, maintenance service, repair service etc.\nEach product has its own benefits, application, brand name, and packaging that gives it its own identity and distinguishing characteristics.\n\nEvery business or organization has business rules that define precisely what a product is.    While we intuitively know what a product is, we must quantify that knowledge and associated business rules with consistent definitions that can be implemented within the organization in strategies and applications.\n\nA product typically goes through five stages of development:\n\n(1) Idea Stage - involving a thorough evaluation of the potential product\n\n(2) Concept Stage - determines customer acceptance by testing and presentation to consumers and distribution channel members.   Specific aspects regarding quality, dependability, reliability, warranty, packaging, service, pricing, terms of sale, sales and distribution channels, advertising and promotions are evaluated.\n\n(3) Product Development Stage - transforms the prototype product into an actual product for mass sale.   This stage requires close interaction between both marketing and manufacturing.\n\n(4) Test Marketing Stage - may or may not be used since it is an expensive and time-consuming process.  Test marketing involves evaluating various product options and alternatives.\n\n(5) Commercialization - It is very expensive to launch a new product so commercialization only applies to those specific products that are actually going to be sold to the market.\n\nProducts tend to be categorized as either:  Industrial goods and consumer goods\n\nIndustrial goods are used to produce other products .\n\nIndustrial goods may be further divided into:\n\n- Raw materials\n- Equipment\n- Pre-built materials \n- Supplies.\n\nConsumer goods are intended for consumption by the general public.\n\nConsumer goods may be further divided into:\n\n- Durable goods\n- Nondurable goods\n- Packaged goods\n\nA product may be a member of a product family or product line.\n\nA product family is a grouping of products or services that are related to each other by common function, functionality, design platform or similar characteristics.\n\nMembers of a product family frequently have many common parts and assemblies.\n\nProduct families are the highest level of grouping for forecasting, capacity planning or related functions.\n\nEx:\nThe Apple Macintosh family of products consists of the product lines:\n- Mac mini\n- MacBook Pro\n- Mac Pro\n\nA product line is a grouping of products that are closely related in usage, functionality or marketing characteristics.\n\nA Product Family typically is created to address one or five functions:\n\n1. To increase profits and not erode the sales of existing products\n\n2. To attract additional Markets or Market Segments\n\n3. To counter competitor's products\n\n4. To fill a gap in an existing Product Family.\n\n5. To promote sales of other products in the family line\n\nLine Depth refers to the number of products in the product line.\n\nLine consistency refers to how closely related the products are that make up the product line.\n\nLine vulnerability refers to the percentage of sales or profits that are derived from only a few products in the product line.\n\nProduct width refers to the number of different product lines sold by a company.\n\nProduct mix refers to the total number of products sold in all product lines.\n\nLine extension refers to the adding of a new product to a line.\n\n\"Trading up or brand leveraging\" refers to adding a product of better quality to a product line than the other products in that line.\n\n\"Trading down\" refers to adding a product of lesser quality to a product line than the other products in that line.\n\nIf a line of products is sold with the same brand name, this is referred to as family branding.\nStrategy and decisions regarding a product line are usually incorporated in a high-level marketing plan addressing product line strategy, sales, channels, distribution channels, pricing and related issues.\nA product-line manager is responsible for a product line and supervises several product managers who are responsible for individual products within the line.\nProduct-line managers typically have the following responsibilities:\n- Expansion and composition of a product line\n- Evaluate the effects of product mixes on the profitability of other items in the line\n- Planning and allocation of resources to individual products in the line\nA product is normally associated with a brand strategy - manufacturer, private or generic.\n\n1. Manufacturer-  or 'national' branding in which the brand is assigned by the manufacturer of the Product.\n\n2. Private - or 'dealer' branding in which the brand is assigned by the retailer or wholesaler of the Product.\n\n3. Generic - in which the Product is not marked with any identification.   Generic brands are a means for manufacturers to increase profits by saving on advertising, packaging or other costs associated with manufacturer or private branding.\n\nA brand is name, term, sign, symbol or design or a combination of these which identify the goods or services and differentiate them from those of competitors'\n\nA Trade mark is a brand or some part of the brand that is given legal protection because it is capable of exclusive appropriation and representation.\n\nManufacturers can use their own brands (known as Manufacturers' brands) or brands of their distributors (Distributors' brands).\n\nManufacturers/ distributors use brand names for a variety of reasons ranging from simple identification purposes to having legal protection for unique features of the products from imitations.\n\nBrands help consumers recognize certain quality parameters. In some cases, brands are just used to endow the product with unique story and character which itself can be a basis for product differentiation.\n\nIndividual brands have their own identity and the corporate or common name is not used to promote its equity.\n\nIndividual branding requires more expensive advertising and brand extensive brand creation investments.  By extension, each new brand does not benefit from the positive perceptions of earlier brands.\n\nBy contrast, family branding has several advantages.\n\nEach new product is quickly associated with the other products and brand in terms of quality and benefits.\n\nReduced or eliminated time for name identification and advertising for name recognition purposes.",

							"Description": "A customer is an individual or legal entity that has or has purchased a product or service.\n\nA potential customer is an individual or legal entity that has the desire to acquire a product or service, the financial ability to pay for that product or service and is located in a location in which the product or service can be delivered to them.\n\nThe definition of 'customer' is of critical importance for every organization.    \n\nIt is the customer that is the focus of product planning, marketing, sales, service, reporting and analytics.    Without 'customer' there would be no need for the organization to exist since its purpose is to serve the customer and profit from that interaction.\n\nThe definition of 'customer' must be consistent with how customers exist and interact with the organization in the real world.  An artificial or conceptual definition of 'customer' that is not consistent with these two objectives is doomed to fail because the data will not be consistent with the definition and employees will not accept concepts or terms that are not consistent with what they see, know and how they interact with customers on a working basis.\n\nMicrosoft defines 'customer' to meet these objectives.    When we look out into the real world we see two dominant types of customers:  human beings and legal entities.     \n\nHuman beings are obviously male and female individuals of various ages, sex, demographics and a variety of similar dimensions that describe and define them who purchase products, good and services.    \n\nLegal entities are those legally-defined entities such as corporations, partnerships, non-profit organizations, government organizations etc. that purchase products, goods and services.\n\nThis view of 'customer' is consistent with the real world and consistent with how employees view and interact with customers.\n\nOf course, that is just the start of identifying, defining and understanding each type of 'customer'.     There is a great deal of detail, complexity and related data that can be used to define each type of customer to various levels of detail and different dimensions of information.\n\nMicrosoft implements these detailed concepts and related data via two distinct business area models that expand the coverage and complexity of each type of customer:\n\n-  INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER Business Area Model\n-  LEGAL ENTITY CUSTOMER Business Area Model\n\nNote:\nEach of the Microsoft models - enterprise, business area or data warehouse - have a representative level of detail for the appropriate type of customer, which is a 'subset' of the total data available in the associated INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER or LEGAL ENTITY CUSTOMER business area models..   Reference either of those models to expand the coverage or level of detail in each respective data model.\n\nThe actual customer implemented in each model depends upon the dominant use of customer for that industry.     \n\nFor example, in the pharmaceutical industry the customer is a legal entity, which represents another corporation, company, government organization etc. that purchases the pharmaceutical product and then distributes that product to the end-customer, which is an individual in a retail environment or a government-distribution scheme.    \n\nFor this example, the pharmaceutical models will have the legal entity customer represented but not the individual 'end customer' since that is represented in the appropriate retail industry models, which are a different offering.     \n\nOf course, the entire set of data available for a legal entity customer is contained in the associated LEGAL ENTITY CUSTOMER Business Area Model.   Reference the LEGAL ENTITY CUSTOMER Business Area Model to incorporate additional data that may be of relevance.\n\nIn many industries both types of customers are represented since a legal entity or individual can purchase products, goods or services and enter into contracts.    For these industries, both types of customers are represented by some of the more significant or relevant data derived from the associated LEGAL ENTITY or INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER business area models.   These models can be used to expand the scope or level of detail in any of the enterprise, business area or data warehouse models.",

Investing and financing activities represents cash from external sources.\n\nThe cash flow statement is a reordering of information from the balance sheet.   The balance sheet shows account balances at the end of an accounting period, whereas the statement of cash flows shows 'changes' in the same account balances between accounting periods. \n\nIt is a statement of 'flows' because it shows changes over time rather than the absolute dollar amount of the accounts at a point in time as with the balance sheet.\n\nThe statement of cash flows is prepared by calculating the changes in all of the balance sheet accounts and then listing the accounts as inflows/outflows by operating, financing and investing activities.\n\nThe inflows less the outflows balance to and explain the change in the cash position.\n\nThe Cash Flow Statement helps management estimate future cash requirements.\n\nThe Cash Flow Statement has 3 sections:   \n\n(1)  Cash Flow From Operating Activities\n(2)  Cash Flow From Investing Activities\n(3)  Cash Flow From Financing Activities\n\nThe example below shows the Direct Method of Cash Flow Statement Preparation in which debits and credits are summarized directly to the Cash account.",

'AAA' is the highest Issuer Credit Rating assigned by Standard & Poor's. \n\nAA - An obligor rated 'AA' has VERY STRONG capacity to meet its financial commitments. It differs from the highest rated obligors only in small degree. \n\nA - An obligor rated 'A' has STRONG capacity to meet its financial commitments but is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligors in higher-rated categories. \n\nBBB - An obligor rated 'BBB' has ADEQUATE capacity to meet its financial commitments. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitments. \n\nObligors rated 'BB', 'B', 'CCC' and 'CC' are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. 'BB' indicates the least degree of speculation and 'CC' the highest. While such obligors will likely have some quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions. \n\nBB - An obligor rated 'BB' is LESS VULNERABLE in the near term than other lower-rated obligors. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties and exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments. \n\nB - An obligor rated 'B' is MORE VULNERABLE than the obligors rated 'BB', but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitments. Adverse business, financial, or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor's capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitments. \n\nCCC - An obligor rated 'CCC' is CURRENTLY VULNERABLE, and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions to meet its financial commitments. \n\nCC - An obligor rated 'CC' is CURRENTLY HIGHLY-VULNERABLE. \nPlus (+) or minus (-): - The ratings from 'AA' to 'CCC' may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. \n\nR - An obligor rated 'R' is under regulatory supervision owing to its financial condition. During the pendency of the regulatory supervision the regulators may have the power to favor one class of obligations over others or pay some obligations and not others. Please see Standard & Poor's issue credit ratings for a more detailed description of the effects of regulatory supervision on specific issues or classes of obligations. \n\nSD and D - An obligor rated 'SD' (Selective Default) or 'D' has failed to pay one or more of its financial obligations (rated or unrated) when it became due. \nA 'D' rating is assigned when Standard & Poor's believes that the default will be a general default and that the obligor will fail to pay all or substantially all of its obligations as they become due. An 'SD' rating is assigned when Standard & Poor's believes that the obligor has selectively defaulted on a specific issue or class of obligations but it will continue to meet its payment obligations on other issues or classes of obligations in a timely manner. Please see Standard & Poor's issue credit ratings for a more detailed description of the effects of a default on specific issues or classes of obligations. \n\nN.R. - An issuer designated N.R. is not rated. \n\nFitch Investors Service bond ratings:\n------------------------------------------------\nHighest quality = AAA\nHigh quality = AA\nUpper medium quality = A\nMedium grade = BBB\nSomewhat speculative = BB\nLow grade, speculative = B\nLow grade, default possible = CCC\nLow grade, partial recovery possible = CC\nImminent default = C\nDefault = D\n\nStandard & Poor's bond ratings:\n------------------------------------------\nHighest quality = AAA\nHigh quality = AA\nUpper medium quality = A\nMedium grade = BBB\nSomewhat speculative = BB\nLow grade, speculative = B\nLow grade, default possible = CCC\nLow grade, partial recovery possible = CC\nDefault, recovery unlikely = C\n\nDuff & Phelps bond ratings:\n------------------------------------\nHighest quality = AAA\nHigh quality = AA\nUpper medium quality = A\nMedium grade = BBB\nSomewhat speculative = BB\nLow grade, speculative = B\nLow grade, default possible = CCC\nLow grade, partial recovery possible = CC\nImminent default = C\nDefault = D\n\nMoody's Bond \n--------------------\nAaa - Bonds which are rated AaAA are judged to be of the best quality. They carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as \"gilt edged.\" Interest payments are protected by a large or an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are likely to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues. \n\nAa - Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards. Together with the AAA group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in \n\nAaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the long-term risk appear somewhat larger than the Aaa securities. \n\nA - Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and are considered as upper-medium-grade obligations. Factors giving security to principal and interest are considered\nadequate, but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment some time in the future. \n\nBaa - Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium-grade obligations (i.e., they are neither highly protected not poorly secured). Interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well. \n\nBa \nBonds which are rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements; their future cannot be considered as well-assured. Often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate, and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future. Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class. \n\nB - Bonds which are rated B generally lack characteristics of the desirable investment. Assurance of interest and principal payments of maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small. \n\nCaa - Bonds which are rated CAA are of poor standing. Such issues may be in default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest. \n\nCa -Bonds which are rated Ca represent obligations which are speculative in a high degree. Such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings. \n\nC - Bonds which are rated C are the lowest rated class of bonds, and issues so rated can be regarded  having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining any real investment standing.\n\nStandard and Poor's Commercial Paper Rating\n\nA-1/Prime-1\nThe highest rating; it indicates a strong degree of safety concerning timely payment. Issues with extremely strong safety characteristics are designated as A-1+/Prime-1+.\n\nA-2/Prime-2\nThe rating for a satisfactory security; the relative safety of an investment in this rating category is not as high as in the A-1/Prime-1 category.\n\nA-3/Prime-3\nThe rating for an adequate level of investment safety. Issues with this rating are more susceptible to market fluctuations than obligations with higher ratings.\n\nB\nIssues rated B are regarded as having only speculative capacity for timely payment.\n\nC\nThis rating is assigned to short-term debt obligations with a doubtful capacity for payment.\n\nD\nDebt rated D is in payment default. The D rating category is used when interest payments or principal payments are not made on the due date, even if the applicable grace period has not expired, unless Standard & Poor's believes such payments will be made during such grace period.",

							"Description": "The definition of Currency is based upon the ISO 4217 standard.\n\nISO 4217 is the international standard describing three letter codes (also known as the currency code) to define the names of currencies established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). \n\nThe first two letters of the code are the two letters of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes (which are similar to those used for national top-level domains on the Internet) and the third is usually the initial of the currency itself. So Japan's currency code becomes JPY-JP for Japan and Y for yen. This eliminates the problem caused by the names dollar, franc and pound being used in dozens of different countries, each having significantly differing values. Also, if a currency is revalued, the currency code's last letter is changed to distinguish it from the old currency. In some cases, the third letter is the initial for \"new\" in that country's language, to distinguish it from an older currency that was revalued; the code often long outlasts the usage of the term \"new\" itself. Examples of this include the Mexican peso (MXN) and the Turkish lira (TRY). Other changes can be seen, however; the Russian ruble, for example, changed from RUR to RUB, where the B comes from the third letter in the word \"ruble\".\n\nThere is also a three-digit code number assigned to each currency, in the same manner as there is also a three-digit code number assigned to each country as part of ISO 3166. This numeric code is usually the same as the ISO 3166 numeric code. For example, USD (US Dollar) has code 840 which is also the numeric code for US (United States).\n\nThe standard also defines the relationship between the major currency unit and any minor currency unit. Often, the minor currency unit has a value that is 1/100 of the major unit, but 1/10 or 1/1000 are also common. Some currencies do not have any minor currency unit at all. In others, the major currency unit has so little value that the minor unit is no longer generally used (e.g. the Japanese sen, 1/100th of a yen). Mauritania does not use a decimal division of units, setting 1 ouguiya (UM) = 5 khoums, and Madagascar has 1 ariary = 5 iraimbilanja. This is indicated in the standard by the currency exponent. For example USD has exponent 2, while JPY has exponent 0.\n\nISO 4217 includes codes not only for currencies, but also for precious metals (gold, silver, palladium and platinum; by definition expressed per one troy ounce, as compared to \"1 USD\") and certain other entities used in international finance, e.g. Special Drawing Rights. There are also special codes allocated for testing purposes (XTS), and to indicate no currency transactions (XXX). These codes all begin with the letter \"X\". The precious metals use \"X\" plus the metal's chemical symbol; silver, for example, is XAG. ISO 3166 never assigns country codes beginning with \"X\" while these codes are assigned for privately customized use only (reserved, never for official codes), so ISO 4217 can use \"X\" codes for non-country-specific currencies without risk of clashing with future country codes.\n\nThis is a list of global currencies and the three-character currency codes that we have found are generally used to represent them. \n\nIn most cases, the currency code is composed of the country's two-character Internet country code plus an extra character to denote the currency unit.\n\nFor example, the code for Canadian Dollars is simply Canada's two-character Internet code (\"CA\") plus a one-character currency designator (\"D\").\n\nISO 4217 (Codes for the Representation of Currencies and Funds) defines three-letter abbreviations for world currencies. \n\nThe general principle used to construct these abbreviations is to take the two-letter abbreviations defined in ISO 3166 (Codes for the Representation of Names of Countries) and append the first letter of the currency name (e.g., USD for the United States \n\nIn the case of currencies defined by supra-national entities, ISO 4217 assigns two-letter entity codes starting with \"X\" to use in place of country codes (e.g., XCD for the Central Caribbean Dollar). \n\nThe following are examples:\n\nUSD  America (United States of America), Dollars\nAUD  Australia, Dollars\nCAD  Canada, Dollars",

So Japan's currency code becomes JPY-JP for Japan and Y for yen. This eliminates the problem caused by the names dollar, franc and pound being used in dozens of different countries, each having significantly differing values. Also, if a currency is revalued, the currency code's last letter is changed to distinguish it from the old currency. In some cases, the third letter is the initial for \\\"new\\\" in that country's language, to distinguish it from an older currency that was revalued; the code often long outlasts the usage of the term \\\"new\\\" itself. Examples of this include the Mexican peso (MXN) and the Turkish lira (TRY). Other changes can be seen, however; the Russian ruble, for example, changed from RUR to RUB, where the B comes from the third letter in the word \\\"ruble\\\".\\n\\nThere is also a three-digit code number assigned to each currency, in the same manner as there is also a three-digit code number assigned to each country as part of ISO 3166. This numeric code is usually the same as the ISO 3166 numeric code. For example, USD (US Dollar) has code 840 which is also the numeric code for US (United States).\\n\\nThe standard also defines the relationship between the major currency unit and any minor currency unit. Often, the minor currency unit has a value that is 1/100 of the major unit, but 1/10 or 1/1000 are also common. Some currencies do not have any minor currency unit at all. In others, the major currency unit has so little value that the minor unit is no longer generally used (e.g. the Japanese sen, 1/100th of a yen). Mauritania does not use a decimal division of units, setting 1 ouguiya (UM) = 5 khoums, and Madagascar has 1 ariary = 5 iraimbilanja. This is indicated in the standard by the currency exponent. For example USD has exponent 2, while JPY has exponent 0.\\n\\nISO 4217 includes codes not only for currencies, but also for precious metals (gold, silver, palladium and platinum; by definition expressed per one troy ounce, as compared to \\\"1 USD\\\") and certain other entities used in international finance, e.g. Special Drawing Rights. There are also special codes allocated for testing purposes (XTS), and to indicate no currency transactions (XXX). These codes all begin with the letter \\\"X\\\". The precious metals use \\\"X\\\" plus the metal's chemical symbol; silver, for example, is XAG. ISO 3166 never assigns country codes beginning with \\\"X\\\" while these codes are assigned for privately customized use only (reserved, never for official codes), so ISO 4217 can use \\\"X\\\" codes for non-country-specific currencies without risk of clashing with future country codes.\\n\\nThis is a list of global currencies and the three-character currency codes that we have found are generally used to represent them. \\n\\nIn most cases, the currency code is composed of the country's two-character Internet country code plus an extra character to denote the currency unit.\\n\\nFor example, the code for Canadian Dollars is simply Canada's two-character Internet code (\\\"CA\\\") plus a one-character currency designator (\\\"D\\\").\\n\\nISO 4217 (Codes for the Representation of Currencies and Funds) defines three-letter abbreviations for world currencies. \\n\\nThe general principle used to construct these abbreviations is to take the two-letter abbreviations defined in ISO 3166 (Codes for the Representation of Names of Countries) and append the first letter of the currency name (e.g., USD for the United States \\n\\nIn the case of currencies defined by supra-national entities, ISO 4217 assigns two-letter entity codes starting with \\\"X\\\" to use in place of country codes (e.g., XCD for the Central Caribbean Dollar). \\n\\nThe following are examples:\\n\\nUSD  America (United States of America), Dollars\\nAUD  Australia, Dollars\\nCAD  Canada, Dollars\",\"primaryKey\":[\"IsoCurrencyCode\"],\"projectionInfo\":{\"attributes\":[{\"type\":\"Existing\",\"attributeReference\":{\"entity\":\"Currency.cdm.json/Currency\",\"name\":\"IsoCurrencyCode\"},\"dataType\":\"string\",\"dataTypeLength\":3,\"description\":\"The ISO 4217 currency code.\",\"isNullable\":false,\"name\":\"IsoCurrencyCode\"},{\"type\":\"Existing\",\"attributeReference\":{\"entity\":\"Currency.cdm.json/Currency\",\"name\":\"CurrencyName\"},\"dataType\":\"string\",\"dataTypeLength\":128,\"description\":\"The name of the currency.\",\"isNullable\":true,\"name\":\"CurrencyName\"},{\"type\":\"Existing\",\"attributeReference\":{\"entity\":\"Currency.cdm.json/Currency\",\"name\":\"CountryId\"},\"dataType\":\"integer\",\"description\":\"The unique identifier of the Country.\",\"isNullable\":true,\"name\":\"CountryId\"},{\"type\":\"Existing\",\"attributeReference\":{\"entity\":\"Currency.cdm.json/Currency\",\"name\":\"CurrencySymbol\"},\"dataType\":\"binary\",\"description\":\"The symbol associated with the currency.\",\"isNullable\":true,\"name\":\"CurrencySymbol\"}]}}}",

Without 'customer' there would be no need for the organization to exist since its purpose is to serve the customer and profit from that interaction.\n\nThe definition of 'customer' must be consistent with how customers exist and interact with the organization in the real world.  An artificial or conceptual definition of 'customer' that is not consistent with these two objectives is doomed to fail because the data will not be consistent with the definition and employees will not accept concepts or terms that are not consistent with what they see, know and how they interact with customers on a working basis.\n\nMicrosoft defines 'customer' to meet these objectives.    When we look out into the real world we see two dominant types of customers:  human beings and legal entities.     \n\nHuman beings are obviously male and female individuals of various ages, sex, demographics and a variety of similar dimensions that describe and define them who purchase products, good and services.    \n\nLegal entities are those legally-defined entities such as corporations, partnerships, non-profit organizations, government organizations etc. that purchase products, goods and services.\n\nThis view of 'customer' is consistent with the real world and consistent with how employees view and interact with customers.\n\nOf course, that is just the start of identifying, defining and understanding each type of 'customer'.     There is a great deal of detail, complexity and related data that can be used to define each type of customer to various levels of detail and different dimensions of information.\n\nMicrosoft implements these detailed concepts and related data via two distinct business area models that expand the coverage and complexity of each type of customer:\n\n-  INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER Business Area Model\n-  LEGAL ENTITY CUSTOMER Business Area Model\n\nNote:\nEach of the Microsoft models - enterprise, business area or data warehouse - have a representative level of detail for the appropriate type of customer, which is a 'subset' of the total data available in the associated INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER or LEGAL ENTITY CUSTOMER business area models..   Reference either of those models to expand the coverage or level of detail in each respective data model.\n\nThe actual customer implemented in each model depends upon the dominant use of customer for that industry.     \n\nFor example, in the pharmaceutical industry the customer is a legal entity, which represents another corporation, company, government organization etc. that purchases the pharmaceutical product and then distributes that product to the end-customer, which is an individual in a retail environment or a government-distribution scheme.    \n\nFor this example, the pharmaceutical models will have the legal entity customer represented but not the individual 'end customer' since that is represented in the appropriate retail industry models, which are a different offering.     \n\nOf course, the entire set of data available for a legal entity customer is contained in the associated LEGAL ENTITY CUSTOMER Business Area Model.   Reference the LEGAL ENTITY CUSTOMER Business Area Model to incorporate additional data that may be of relevance.\n\nIn many industries both types of customers are represented since a legal entity or individual can purchase products, goods or services and enter into contracts.    For these industries, both types of customers are represented by some of the more significant or relevant data derived from the associated LEGAL ENTITY or INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER business area models.

								"Description": "A customer is an individual or legal entity that has or has purchased a product or service.\n\nA potential customer is an individual or legal entity that has the desire to acquire a product or service, the financial ability to pay for that product or service and is located in a location in which the product or service can be delivered to them.\n\nThe definition of 'customer' is of critical importance for every organization.    \n\nIt is the customer that is the focus of product planning, marketing, sales, service, reporting and analytics.    Without 'customer' there would be no need for the organization to exist since its purpose is to serve the customer and profit from that interaction.\n\nThe definition of 'customer' must be consistent with how customers exist and interact with the organization in the real world.  An artificial or conceptual definition of 'customer' that is not consistent with these two objectives is doomed to fail because the data will not be consistent with the definition and employees will not accept concepts or terms that are not consistent with what they see, know and how they interact with customers on a working basis.\n\nMicrosoft defines 'customer' to meet these objectives.    When we look out into the real world we see two dominant types of customers:  human beings and legal entities.     \n\nHuman beings are obviously male and female individuals of various ages, sex, demographics and a variety of similar dimensions that describe and define them who purchase products, good and services.    \n\nLegal entities are those legally-defined entities such as corporations, partnerships, non-profit organizations, government organizations etc. that purchase products, goods and services.\n\nThis view of 'customer' is consistent with the real world and consistent with how employees view and interact with customers.\n\nOf course, that is just the start of identifying, defining and understanding each type of 'customer'.     There is a great deal of detail, complexity and related data that can be used to define each type of customer to various levels of detail and different dimensions of information.\n\nMicrosoft implements these detailed concepts and related data via two distinct business area models that expand the coverage and complexity of each type of customer:\n\n-  INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER Business Area Model\n-  LEGAL ENTITY CUSTOMER Business Area Model\n\nNote:\nEach of the Microsoft models - enterprise, business area or data warehouse - have a representative level of detail for the appropriate type of customer, which is a 'subset' of the total data available in the associated INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER or LEGAL ENTITY CUSTOMER business area models..   Reference either of those models to expand the coverage or level of detail in each respective data model.\n\nThe actual customer implemented in each model depends upon the dominant use of customer for that industry.     \n\nFor example, in the pharmaceutical industry the customer is a legal entity, which represents another corporation, company, government organization etc. that purchases the pharmaceutical product and then distributes that product to the end-customer, which is an individual in a retail environment or a government-distribution scheme.    \n\nFor this example, the pharmaceutical models will have the legal entity customer represented but not the individual 'end customer' since that is represented in the appropriate retail industry models, which are a different offering.     \n\nOf course, the entire set of data available for a legal entity customer is contained in the associated LEGAL ENTITY CUSTOMER Business Area Model.

							"Description": "An accounting method for spreading out the original cost over the estimated life of the fixed assets.\n\nDepreciation expense is listed in the Income Statement and reduces the net income for that year.\n\nPopular Depreciation Methods are:\n\nDECLINING BALANCE\nDeclining Balance  is an accelerated depreciation method in which an asset's book value is multiplied by a constant depreciation rate (such as double the straight-line percentage, in the case of double-declining-balance.). \n\nThis depreciation method is allowed by the U.S. tax code and gives a larger depreciation in the early years of an asset. Unlike the straight line and the sum of the digits methods, both of which use the original basis to calculate the depreciation each year, the double declining balance uses a fixed percentage of the prior year's basis to calculate depreciation. The percentage rate is 2/N where N is the life of the asset. \n\nWith this method, the basis never becomes zero. Consequently, it is standard practice to switch to another depreciation method as the basis decreases. Usually the taxpayer will convert to the straight line method when the annual depreciation from the declining balance becomes less than the straight line.\n\nSTRAIGHT-LINE\nThe straight-line method of depreciation charges equal amounts of depreciation to each period over the useful life of the asset. It is determined by subtracting the residual value from the initial cost and dividing it by the number of the years of estimated life.  Due to its simplicity, it is the most widely used method.\n\nACCELERATED\nA method of depreciation that recognizes higher amounts of depreciation in the earlier years and lower amounts in the later years of a fixed asset's life.  Greater tax benefits are taken in the earlier years.   Over an extended period of time as depreciation moves down the maintenance costs increase and tend to even out the charges to income.\n\nACCELERATED (ACRS)\nA system of depreciation for tax purposes as mandated by the Economic Recovery Act (ERA) of 1981 and modified by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Fixed Assets are identified by class and depreciation is determined by this class as opposed to statutory tables. A taxpayer may make an irrevocable decision to treat all property in one of the classes.  The purpose of ACRS is to encourage capital investments by business by permitting a faster recovery of the asset cost, which provides larger tax benefits in the earlier years.\n\nPERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION\nPERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING is instituted if your revenues exceed $10,000,000 (3-year average) or your contracts will not be completed within a two-year period, you are generally required to use the percentage of completion accounting for contracts. There are many advantages to using to percentage of completion method including:  It is the best measurement of income. Percentage of completion normally needs to be computed for financial statement purposes eliminating confusing timing differences from tax to financial statements. \n\nUNITS-OF-PRODUCTION\nThe units-of-production method determines depreciation expense based on the amount the asset is used. The length of life of an asset is expressed in a form of productive capacity. The initial cost less any residual value is divided by productive capacity to determine a rate of unit-of-production depreciation per units of usage. Units of usage c\ncan be expressed in quantity of goods produced, hours used, number of cuttings, miles driven or tons hauled, for instance. The depreciation expense of a period is determined by multiplying usage by a fixed unit-of-production rate of usage. This depreciation method is commonly used when asset usage varies from year-to-year.\n\nSUM-OF-YEARS-DIGITS\nThe sum-of-the-years-digits method is an another form of accelerated depreciation. The annual depreciation is calculated by subtracting salvage value from original cost, and multiplying this figure by a fractional rate of depreciation. The denominator of the fraction is the sum of the years of useful life; for a life of 5 years, the denominator is = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. The numerator is the year in reverse order. For the first year, the numerator is 5 and the fraction is 5/15.\n\nMODIFIED ACCELERATED COST RECOVERY (MACRS)\nA method of accelerated depreciation which classifies depreciable assets into a specific recovery period, each of which has a designated allowable depreciation method.\n\nMODIFIED ACCELERATED COST RECOVERY SYSTEM (MACRS) is a system used in accounting to define the rate and method under which a fixed asset will be depreciated for tax purposes.\n\nDOUBLE DECLINING BALANCE\nAn accelerated depreciation method in which a percentage factor of twice the straight-line rate is multiplied each year by the declining balance of the asset's book value.   To determine the annual depreciation expense, the asset's book value at the beginning of the period is multiplied by the double declining rate.",

The revenue is equal to the cash, accounts receivable and other assets gained in compensation for goods sold or services rendered.\n\nEXPENSES = The decrease in capital that is the result of the business' revenue-producing operations.   The expenses amount is equal to the value of the goods and services used up or consumed in obtaining the revenue.\n\nNET INCOME = The increase in capital that is the result from profitable operation of the business during the period.   It is the excess of revenues over expenses for the accounting period.\n\nNET LOSS = The decrease in capital resulting from the operations of the business.   It is the excess of expenses over revenue for the operating period.\n\nThe statement of retained earnings is often combined with the income statement or incorporated into the statement of shareholder's equity (see bottom of this example).\n\nIt is a record of its earnings or losses for a given period. It shows all of the money a company earned (revenues) and all of the money a company spent (expenses) during this period. \n\nIt documents the changes in the balance sheet retained earnings account from one period to the next (see Stockholders Equity Retained Earnings).\n\nIt also accounts for the effects of some basic accounting principles such as depreciation.\n\nIt is for a specific period of time, where the balance sheet is at a specific instance of time.\n\nThe Income Statement reports cash flows on the accrual basis or inflows measured as revenues and outflows measured as expenses.\n\nAnother name for the Income Statement is the Profit & Loss Statement.",

								"Description": "The income statement details the amount of income and how it was earned. \n\nIt is a summary of the revenue, expenses and net income/net loss of the legal entity for a specific period where:\n\nREVENUE = The increase in capital as a result of the sale of goods or services provided by the business.   The revenue is equal to the cash, accounts receivable and other assets gained in compensation for goods sold or services rendered.\n\nEXPENSES = The decrease in capital that is the result of the business' revenue-producing operations.   The expenses amount is equal to the value of the goods and services used up or consumed in obtaining the revenue.\n\nNET INCOME = The increase in capital that is the result from profitable operation of the business during the period.   It is the excess of revenues over expenses for the accounting period.\n\nNET LOSS = The decrease in capital resulting from the operations of the business.   It is the excess of expenses over revenue for the operating period.\n\nThe statement of retained earnings is often combined with the income statement or incorporated into the statement of shareholder's equity (see bottom of this example).\n\nIt is a record of its earnings or losses for a given period. It shows all of the money a company earned (revenues) and all of the money a company spent (expenses) during this period. \n\nIt documents the changes in the balance sheet retained earnings account from one period to the next (see Stockholders Equity Retained Earnings).\n\nIt also accounts for the effects of some basic accounting principles such as depreciation.\n\nIt is for a specific period of time, where the balance sheet is at a specific instance of time.\n\nThe Income Statement reports cash flows on the accrual basis or inflows measured as revenues and outflows measured as expenses.\n\nAnother name for the Income Statement is the Profit & Loss Statement.",

								"Description": "A Transaction records the economic events of the enterprise recorded by accountants to accounts.\n\nTransactions are activities that affect what a business owns, what a business owes and the ownership of the business.   \n\nTransactions are recorded in account(s).     The purpose of the account is to record the information about each business transaction.     \n\nEach part of the transaction will have an effect on a specific ledger account.\n\nEach business transaction involves changes to at least two accounts in a double entry account system.  For any transaction, debits must equal credits.\n\nEach transaction causes at least two changes on the balance sheet.\nTransactions must be reported consistently in the same way from period to period.\n\nThere are two parties involved in each transaction:   The legal entity recording the transaction (RECORD-KEEPING LEGAL ENTITY) and the other party involved (PARTY).     The other party can also be a legal entity so \"Reporting Legal Entity\" makes it clear that is the business keeping the books.\n\nEach transaction is first entered into a journal or 'day book' and then posted to a ledger.\n\nNote:\nNot all events are transactions.  For example, a change in value of an asset such as land is an example.\n\nBanking Example:\nWhen you deposit a check the bank credits your checking account and debits their cash position.\n\nNote:  Related Transactions are handled by the source document rather than an explicit RELATED TRANSACTION entity.

PARTY enables the organization to identify and define each customer as a single party and relate (cleanse and synchronize) the multiple instances of customer to a single set of customer information.\n\nIt also allows the business to look at the multiple relationships that exist among parties playing different roles over various periods of time.    \n\nFor example, a business might have a vendor who is also a customer that has employees who are also customers of the business.     A business might have employees who are also customers and whose spouse or family members are also customers.\n\nIn short, party enables the business to examine and record the real-world interactions of individuals, organizations, legal entities, social organizations and business units as they perform those many roles that characterize their activities and relationships to other parties.      Party also provides an 'anchor' upon which to resolve multiple instances or definitions of that party so the business can develop a 'single-view' of the party.",

							"Description": "A method or source for identifying Financial Products.  \n\nThere are currently 65 national numbering agencies issuing more than 20 different local codes.  \n\nEx:\n\n- ISIN \n- CUSIP  \n- SEDOL  \n- CEDEL\n- VALOREN  \n- RIC  \n- BLOOMBERG ID\n- FTID FTEX\n- OUICK\n- COMMON CODE\n- EUROCLEAR\n- SIC\n- SICC\n- SICOVAM\n\nCedel   No longer used; replaced by the Common Code on January 1, 1991. \n\nCIN   CUSIP International Number. Used for non-U.S. and non-Canadian securities. Nine characters. The first character is always a letter, which represents the country of issue. The country codes are as follows: A=Austria, B=Belgium, C=China, D=Germany, E=Spain, F=France, G=Great Britain, H=Switzerland, J=Japan, K=Denmark, L=Luxembourg, M= Middle East, N=Netherlands P= South America, Q=Australia, R=Norway, S=South Africa, T= Italy, U= United States, V =Africa(Other), W= Sweden, X=Europe (Other), Y=Asia. The next five characters are numbers which represent the issuer, followed by two digits representing the security. The final digit is the check digit. \nCommon Code   Issued in Luxembourg, replaces CEDEL and Euroclear codes. Nine digits. Final digit is a check digit, computed on a multiplicative system. \n\nCUSIP   Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures. Standard & Poor's assigns a nine character code to stocks and bonds. The first six characters identify the issuer. The next two characters represent the security that was issued, and the ninth character is a check digit, which is computed using a modulus 10 double add double calculation. For Canadian and U.S. securities, the first character is always a digit. Other countries use an alphabetic first character. See CIN number, above. \n\nEuroclear   Not used anymore; replaced by the Common Code on January 1, 1991. \n\nISIN   International Securities Identification Number. This is a twelve character code developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO) that represents a security. The first two letters always represent the country code, and the ISO standards are used. Basically, these are the same two letters as used in Internet addresses (however GB, not UK, is used for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland). The next nine characters usually use some other code, such as CUSIP in North America, SEDOL in the United Kingdom, etc. Leading spaces are padded with 0. The final digit is the check digit, also computed with modulus 10 double add double, but it is different from the method used in CUSIP's. \n\nRIC   Reuter Identification Code. Used on the Reuters Terminal to pull up a particular security. When an equal sign is the last character, that symbol is a master RIC. An RIC that has an equal sign followed by some additional letters means that this string contains the price quoted by some entity. That entity is denoted by those letters following the equal sign. \n\nSEDOL   Stock Exchange Daily Official List. Securities identification code issued by the London Stock Exchange. Has a built in check digit system. \n\nSIC   Standard Industrial Code. Tells what line of business a firm is in, does not symbolize a security. \n\nSICC   Security Identification Code Conference. Used in Japan, usually four digits. Sort of like a ticker in Japan. \n\nSicovam SociÉtÉ Interprofessional Pour La Compensation des Valeurs Mobiliers. Used in France. \n\nSVM   Used in Belgium. \n\nValoren Identifier for Swiss securities. No check digit system.\n\nWertpapier Kenn-nummer  Issued in Germany by the Wertpapier Mitteilungen.

The balance sheet shows account balances at the end of an accounting period, whereas the statement of cash flows shows 'changes' in the same account balances between accounting periods. \n\nIt is a statement of 'flows' because it shows changes over time rather than the absolute dollar amount of the accounts at a point in time as with the balance sheet.\n\nThe Statement of Cash Flows is prepared by calculating the changes in all of the balance sheet accounts and then listing the accounts as inflows/outflows by operating, financing and investing activities.\n\nThe inflows less the outflows balance to and explain the change in the cash position.\n\nThe Statement of Cash Flows helps management estimate future cash requirements.\n\nThe Statement of Cash Flows has 3 sections:   \n\n(1)  Cash Flow From Operating Activities\n(2)  Cash Flow From Investing Activities\n(3)  Cash Flow From Financing Activities",

It is the excess of revenues over expenses for the accounting period.\n\nNET LOSS = The decrease in capital resulting from the operations of the business.   It is the excess of expenses over revenue for the operating period.\n\nIt is a record of its earnings or losses for a given period. It shows all of the money a company earned (revenues) and all of the money a company spent (expenses) during this period. \n\nIt documents the changes in the balance sheet retained earnings account from one period to the next (see Stockholders Equity Retained Earnings).\n\nIt also accounts for the effects of some basic accounting principles such as depreciation.\n\nIt is for a specific period of time, where the balance sheet is at a specific instance of time.",

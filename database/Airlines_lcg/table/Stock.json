		"Description": "A financial instrument that denotes ownership or equity in a corporation and represents a claim on its proportionate share in the corporations assets and profits.\n\nIssuance of stock or equity is one of the methods that a company can raise capital.   Other means are loans and issuance of bonds.   \n\nIssuing stock raises capital without creation of debt or the obligation to repay these funds.\n\nEx:\nADJUSTABLE RATE PREFERRED STOCK (ARPS)\nPreferred stock whose dividend is adjusted rather than fixed at a specific time (normally quarterly) based on changes in the Treasury bill rate or some similar money market rate.\n\nCOMMON STOCK\nStock authorized by a company's charter having par value, stated value or no par value.\n\nStock owners are normally entitled to vote on the selection of directors and important matters and receive dividends for their holdings.\n\nIn the event of a corporate liquidation, the claims of secured and unsecured creditors and bond and preferred stock owners take precedence over the claims of those who own common stock.\n\nThe number and value of issued shares are normally shown plus the number of authorized shares in the balance sheet capital accounts section.\n\nCONVERTIBLE ADJUSTABLE PREFERRED STOCK (CAPS)\nStock whose adjustable interest rate is pegged to Treasury security rates and which can be exchanged during the period after the announcement of each dividend rate for the next period for common stock or cash with a market value equal to the par value of the CAPS.\n\nCONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK\nPreferred stock that can be converted into common stock at the option of the holder.\n\nCUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK\nA preferred stock whose dividends if omitted will accumulate until they are paid out.\n\nCumulative Preferred Stock has preference over common dividends, which cannot be paid until cumulative preferred obligations are paid first.\n\nDEBENTURE STOCK\nA stock issued under an agreement that provides for fixed payments at scheduled intervals. A debenture stock is more similar to a preferred stock than a debenture. In the case of a company's liquidation, it is treated as an equity. Investors will not receive payment until all debt is paid.\n\nDUTCH AUCTION PREFERRED STOCK\nA type of adjustable-rate preferred stock in which the dividend is determined every seven weeks in a Dutch auction process by corporate bidders.\n\nFIRST PREFERRED STOCK\nPreferred stock that has preferential claim on dividends and assets over other preferred stock issues and common stock.\n\nNON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK\nPreferred stock whose holders must forgo dividend payments when the company misses a dividend payment.\n\nPAIRED SHARE\nCommon stocks of two companies under the same management that are sold as a unit.\n\nAlso called 'Siamese shares' or 'stapled stock'.\n\nPARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK\nA preferred stock which in addition to a regular dividend also pays an additional dividend (the participating dividend) when common stock dividends exceed a specific amount.\n\nPREFERRED STOCK\nCapital stock that provides a specific dividend that is paid before any dividends are paid to common stock holders and takes precedence over common stocks in the event of liquidation.\n\nA class of stock that pays a specified dividend set when it is issued.\n\nPreferred stock normally pays less income than bonds of the same company and do not have the price appreciation potential of common stock.\n\nPreferred stockholders do not have any vote for management or on  key issues.   However, they do receive dividends before common stockholders receive their dividends.\n\nPRIOR-PREFERRED STOCK\nPreferred stock which has a higher claim than other preferred stock from the same issuer in terms of dividends and assets in the event of liquidation.\n\nSECOND-PREFERRED STOCK\nPreferred stock which has rights subordinate to those of other preferred stock, on dividends and ,in the event of liquidation, assets.\n\nADR\nThe ADR is a certificate issued by a US bank representing shares of a non-US company which have been deposited with the bank or its custodian. An ADR may represent a multiple or a fraction of a share of the foreign company deposited in the program, a relationship designed to cause the ADR to trade in a price range which is common in US markets. \n\nPersons who hold or acquire shares of the non-US company may deposit them with the bank in exchange for ADRs, and upon request the bank will deliver the underlying shares against the surrender of the ADRs. This is accomplished through their depositary bank and its local custodian. \n\nKnown as the depositary bank, the US bank performs various shareholder functions, such as receiving and disseminating to the ADR investors information relating to the company's shareholder meetings, financial information, rights and exchange offers and collecting and converting to US dollars the dividend payments to which the ADR holders are entitled. \n\nThere are 5 principal types of ADR programs. Set out below is a brief description of each and their various features. A more detailed description follows in\nsection V. The type of ADR program employed depends on the requirements of the issuer. \n\n    1.Unsponsored ADR \n    2.Sponsored-Level I ADR \n    3.Sponsored-Level II ADR \n    4.Sponsored-Level III ADR \n    5.Rule 144A ADR (RADR) \n\nGlobal Depositary Receipts (GDRs) are normally treated in the same way as ADRs and a description of this type of vehicle is included at the end of the\nsection. \n\n1. Unsponsored ADR Programs\n\nAn unsponsored ADR program may be set up by a US bank on its own initiative, without the involvement of the non-US issuer. The US bank establishing an\nunsponsored ADR program is considered to be offering the ADRs to the public in exchange for the shares of the non-US company. Registration with the SEC\nis made on Form F-6, which does not require any disclosure relating to the non-US issuer or any authorization from the company. In addition, this registration\ndoes not give rise to any reporting obligation for the non-US company. \n\nThe US depositary bank retains total discretion over the conduct of the ADR program, including the option to terminate it. \n\n2. Sponsored ADR Programs\n\nIn a sponsored ADR program, the facility is established at the behest of the issuer and maintained by the depositary bank according to a formal agreement\nbetween the issuer and the bank. This agreement, normally called a Deposit Agreement, establishes the terms of operation of the ADR facility. \n\nADRs issued in a sponsored program must be registered with the SEC. The degree of disclosure is contingent on the trading and potential capital raising uses of\nthe ADRs. The following indicates the three levels of sponsored ADR programs: \n\nLevel-I ADRs: Public Over The Counter: (unlisted pink sheets) for foreign companies who want to develop an initial shareholder base. Level I Depositary\nReceipts trade in the Over-The-Counter (OTC) public markets in reliance on the Rule 12g3-2(b) exemption from 1934 Exchange Act registration and reporting.\nLevel-I ADRs provide issuers with a simple and efficient means of building a core group of investors with minimal regulatory and reporting requirements.
